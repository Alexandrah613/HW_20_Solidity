# HW_20_Solidity

In this activity we are programming smart contracts with Solidity. The new start up we're employed at would like to use smart contracts to automate some of the companies finances. In `AssociateProfitSplitter ` we are creating a contract that will accept Ether into the contract and divide the Ether evenly among the associate level employees. This will allow the Human Resources department to pay employees quickly and efficiently.
